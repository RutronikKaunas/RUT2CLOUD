# RUT2CLOUD Evaluation Kit

The RUT2CLOUD evaluation kit has been designed by Rutronik for IoT cloud connectivity projects development and promotion. Low power Renesas Synergy S3A7 MCU and Li-ION battery charger enables the board to be used for portable and battery powered applications. The power source for the Telit modem is switched between USB and battery automatically by the circuit on board. The MCU, modem, GNSS module and sensors might be evaluated independently.

## Legal Disclaimer

The evaluation board including the software is for testing purposes only and, because it has limited functions and limited resilience, is not suitable for permanent use under real conditions. If the evaluation board is nevertheless used under real conditions, this is done at one’s responsibility; any liability of Rutronik is insofar excluded.
